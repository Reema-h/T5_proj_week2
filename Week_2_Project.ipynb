        "### Dataset Overview\n",
        "The RTA Dataset provides a detailed snapshot of road traffic accidents, capturing a range of data from accident conditions to casualty details. This dataset is essential for analyzing patterns and causes of accidents to improve road safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Characteristics\n",
        "- **Entries**: The dataset contains 12,316 entries.\n",
        "- **Features**: There are 32 features in the dataset, which include:\n",
        "  - `Time`: Time when the accident occurred.\n",
        "  - `Day_of_week`: Day of the week.\n",
        "  - `Age_band_of_driver`: Age group of the driver involved.\n",
        "  - `Sex_of_driver`: Gender of the driver.\n",
        "  - `Educational_level`: Educational level of the driver.\n",
        "  - `Type_of_vehicle`: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.\n",
        "  - `Cause_of_accident`: Reported cause of the accident.\n",
        "  - `Accident_severity`: Severity of the accident.\n",
        "- **Target Column**: `Accident_severity` is used as the target column for modeling. This feature classifies the severity of each accident.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "Students will use this dataset to apply various data visualization, modeling, and evaluation techniques learned in class. The primary goal is to build models that can accurately predict the severity of accidents and to identify the key factors that contribute to severe accidents."
